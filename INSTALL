Required Software Packages
=====

Before you can start you need to install the following software packages:

- CMake (https://cmake.org/)
- An MPI implementation, e.g., OpenMPI (https://www.open-mpi.org/) or MPICH (https://www.mpich.org)

Once you've installed the packages, just type ./compile_withcmake.sh.
Alternatively, follow standard CMake install practices.
